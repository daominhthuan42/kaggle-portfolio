## üéØ Objectives

* Perform **EDA** to uncover trends and anomalies
* Visualize demographic and transactional behaviors
* Identify potential **churn customers** and spending groups
* Build predictive models to classify **Credit card churn**.

## üõ† Methodology & Tools

* **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling
* **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
* **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Clustering.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC

## üìä Results & Insights

* Identified key demographic segments (e.g., age groups, income levels) influencing spending
* Detected patterns of **inactive vs active customers**
* Models show promising performance in predicting customer churn
* Insights can help banks design **targeted campaigns** and **risk management strategies**
