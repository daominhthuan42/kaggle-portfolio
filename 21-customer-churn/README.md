# üë• Customer Churn Prediction üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## üìå Overview

Churn prediction is critical for **telecommunications companies**, where retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project analyzes customer demographics, subscription details, and billing information to build a **churn prediction model**.

Dataset link: [Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashadrmammadov/customer-churn-dataset)

**Goals:**

* Identify factors that drive customer churn.
* Build ML models to predict churn (`Yes` / `No`).
* Provide insights to improve retention strategies.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

**Size:** 5,880 records, 20 features.
**Target variable:**

* `Churn` ‚Üí Yes = churned, No = retained.

## üéØ Objectives

* Perform **EDA**: analyze demographics, contracts, billing patterns.
* Engineer meaningful features from tenure, services, and billing.
* Train classification models:

  * Logistic Regression.
  * Random Forest.
  * XGBoost.
* Evaluate using metrics focused on churn prediction:

  * ROC-AUC.
  * Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## üõ† Methodology & Tools

* **Data Cleaning:** handle missing values, convert `TotalCharges`.
* **EDA & Visualization:** churn distribution, service correlations, billing trends.
* **Feature Engineering:** categorical encoding, scaling, tenure buckets.
* **Modeling:** baseline logistic regression ‚Üí tree-based ensemble methods.
* **Evaluation:** focus on Recall (catching churners) + ROC-AUC.

## üìä Key Insights

* **Contract type** is a strong churn driver ‚Üí month-to-month customers churn more.
* **Electronic check** payment method has the highest churn rate.
* Customers without **value-added services** (e.g., OnlineSecurity, TechSupport) are more likely to churn.
* Higher **MonthlyCharges** correlates with higher churn probability.
* **Senior citizens** have slightly higher churn tendency.

## üöÄ Next Steps

* Apply **SMOTE or class weighting** for class imbalance.
* Hyperparameter tuning with **Optuna**.
* Provide **business recommendations** for retention.
