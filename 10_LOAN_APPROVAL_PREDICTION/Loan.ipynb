    "  This dataset is part of the Kaggle Playground Series (Season 4, Episode 10). The data is synthetically generated using patterns and relationships from real-world tabular data. It simulates a binary classification problem with a relatively large number of features and no missing values, making it suitable for experimenting with feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble models.\n",
